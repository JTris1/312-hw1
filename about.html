            Hello! </br></br>
            My name is Johnathon Trisler. I'm majoring in CIT with a focus on Web Development (obviously). 
            Web development has never really been my thing, but I really wasn't all that interested in 
            networking, databases, or cyber security, so here I am. I just want to develop and I think this 
            is a good way to fulfill that. I prefer more of the backend work than the front end because I've 
            always struggled with being creative on the front end, but hopefully these classes can help turn 
            that around a little bit.
        </p>

            For my favorite colors, I always default to the OneHalf color scheme for almost anything. 
            I really like pastels, and this scheme has nice variants of them in my opinion,
            All my terminals, text editors, and IDEs are themed in this. Hopefully this counts :)
